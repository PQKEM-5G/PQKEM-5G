This repository contains the experimental scripts and the experimental data for the research titled "Post-Quantum Key Exchange and Subscriber Identity Encryption in 5G Using ML-KEM (Kyber)".

In order to run the python scripts it needs to install two open source libraries:
1. Cryptography Python package for classical cryptography
    install: pip install cryptography

2. Liboqs python library for post quantum cryptography
    install: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python
